# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}**!,<br>
I'm a developer, designer, and technical artist currently lecturing at Media Design School in their game programming and art courses. If you have an interesting project or opportunity, I'd love to hear about it, and you can reach me by email!
